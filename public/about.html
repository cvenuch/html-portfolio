<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a Senior Frontend Engineer with 9+ years of experience designing and
  developing scalable, high-performance web applications. My core expertise lies
  in React.js, TypeScript, Redux, and modern frontend architecture, with a
  proven ability to deliver platforms serving millions of users globally. I have
  consistently driven measurable impact—improving Core Web Vitals by 35%,
  reducing API latency by 25%, and building design systems that accelerated
  delivery across multiple teams.

  What excites me most is creating user-centered, accessible, and performant
  experiences. I have a strong interest in design systems, performance
  optimization, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), ensuring applications are both
  elegant and inclusive. I enjoy working closely with designers, product
  managers, and backend teams, translating complex requirements into seamless,
  maintainable solutions. Beyond coding, I find fulfillment in mentoring
  engineers, fostering collaborative team cultures, and driving engineering best
  practices that raise the overall bar.

<p>
  A hallmark of my career has been my ability to quickly learn and adapt to new
  technologies. I’ve successfully expanded my expertise from Quality Assurance
  Enginner into Node.js, Express.js, React, Jest, and CI/CD pipelines, enabling
  me to contribute beyond the frontend when needed. My curiosity and growth
  mindset keep me experimenting with emerging frameworks and tools, ensuring I
  stay ahead of industry trends. I thrive in dynamic environments—especially
  startups and product-focused teams—where innovation, ownership, and continuous
  learning are encouraged.
